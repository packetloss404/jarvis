# Getting Started

This guide covers everything you need to install, build, and run Jarvis from source. Jarvis has two codebases: the newer **Rust application** (`jarvis-rs/`) which is cross-platform, and the **legacy Python/Swift application** (project root) which is macOS-only.

## Prerequisites

### Rust Application (jarvis-rs)

The Rust application builds and runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

#### All Platforms

- **Rust toolchain**: Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). The project uses Rust 2021 edition. Any recent stable toolchain (1.75+) should work. There is no `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning a specific version.

  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

- **Git**: Required to clone the repository.

#### macOS

No additional system libraries are needed. The wgpu renderer uses Metal natively, and WebKit is bundled with the OS.

Tested on macOS 13+ (Ventura and later).

#### Linux

The following development libraries are required for the GPU renderer (wgpu/Vulkan), windowing (winit/X11/Wayland), WebKit webviews (wry), and system menu support (muda):

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libx11-dev \
  libxcb1-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev \
  libxkbcommon-x11-dev \
  libwayland-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libsoup-3.0-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libxdo-dev
```

These packages provide:

| Package | Required By |
|---------|------------|
| `libx11-dev`, `libxcb1-dev` | winit (X11 windowing) |
| `libxkbcommon-dev`, `libxkbcommon-x11-dev` | winit (keyboard input) |
| `libwayland-dev` | winit (Wayland windowing) |
| `libgtk-3-dev` | wry, muda (WebView hosting, system menus) |
| `libsoup-3.0-dev`, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` | wry (WebView rendering) |
| `libxdo-dev` | muda (system menu / tray support) |

For Fedora/RHEL-based distributions, the equivalent packages are:

```bash
sudo dnf install \
  libX11-devel \
  libxcb-devel \
  libxkbcommon-devel \
  libxkbcommon-x11-devel \
  wayland-devel \
  gtk3-devel \
  libsoup3-devel \
  webkit2gtk4.1-devel \
  libxdo-devel
```

A GPU driver supporting Vulkan is required at runtime for wgpu.

#### Windows

- **Visual Studio Build Tools** with the "Desktop development with C++" workload (provides the MSVC linker and Windows SDK). The build target is `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- **WebView2 Runtime**: Ships with Windows 10 version 1803+ and all Windows 11 editions. If missing, download from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).
- The `build.rs` in `jarvis-app` uses the `winres` crate to embed `assets/jarvis.ico` as the Windows executable icon.

No additional library installation is needed on Windows.

### Legacy Python/Swift Application (macOS only)

- **macOS 13+** (Ventura or later)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Swift 5.9+** (ships with Xcode 15+)
- A Claude Max subscription (for Claude Code / Agent SDK features)
- Google Gemini API key (optional, for voice routing and skills)

---

## Building the Rust Application

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylan/jarvis.git
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs

# Debug build (faster compile, larger binary, debug symbols)
cargo build

# Release build (optimized, stripped symbols, LTO enabled)
cargo build --release
```

The release profile is configured with:

- `lto = "thin"` (link-time optimization)
- `codegen-units = 1` (maximum optimization)
- `strip = "symbols"` (smaller binary)
- `panic = "abort"` (no unwinding overhead)

### Build Output

After a successful build:

- **Debug**: `jarvis-rs/target/debug/jarvis` (or `jarvis.exe` on Windows)
- **Release**: `jarvis-rs/target/release/jarvis` (or `jarvis.exe` on Windows)

### Running

The binary must be run from a directory where it can locate `assets/panels/`. By default, it looks for `assets/panels/` relative to the current working directory:

```bash
# From the jarvis-rs directory (where assets/ lives)
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs
cargo run

# Or run the release binary directly
./target/release/jarvis
```

If you run the binary from a different directory, the webview panels (terminal, assistant, chat, games, etc.) will not load. You will see a warning in the log:

```
WARN: Panels directory not found -- webviews will have no bundled content
```

### Building the Relay Server

Jarvis includes a standalone WebSocket relay server for mobile-to-desktop bridging:

```bash
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs
cargo build --release --bin jarvis-relay
```

The relay binary is output at `target/release/jarvis-relay`.

---

## Building the Legacy Python/Swift Application

The legacy application uses a Python backend with a Swift/Metal frontend. It only runs on macOS.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd jarvis
./start.sh
```

The `start.sh` script:

1. Creates a Python virtual environment (`.venv/`) if it does not exist
2. Installs/updates Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Builds the Metal app (`metal-app/.build/debug/JarvisBootup`) if needed
4. Runs `main.py`

### Manual Setup

```bash
cd jarvis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the Swift Metal app
cd metal-app
swift build
cd ..

# Run
python main.py
```

### Python Dependencies

The main `requirements.txt` includes:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `websockets` | WebSocket communication |
| `sounddevice` | Audio capture (push-to-talk) |
| `numpy` | Audio processing |
| `google-genai` | Gemini voice routing and skills |
| `httpx` | Async HTTP client |
| `python-dotenv` | `.env` file loading |
| `rich` | Terminal output formatting |
| `aiohttp` | Async HTTP server |
| `pywhispercpp` | Local Whisper transcription |
| `pydantic` | Configuration validation |
| `pyyaml` | YAML config parsing |
| `cryptography` | Crypto operations |

---

## Required Assets and Directory Structure

### Rust Application Assets

The `jarvis-rs/assets/` directory contains all bundled assets:

```
jarvis-rs/assets/
  jarvis-icon.png              # Window icon (embedded at compile time via include_bytes!)
  jarvis.ico                   # Windows executable icon (embedded via winres at build time)
  panels/
    assistant/index.html       # AI assistant panel
    boot/index.html            # Boot animation
    chat/index.html            # Live chat panel
    presence/index.html        # Online presence panel
    settings/index.html        # Settings UI
    status_bar/index.html      # Status bar
    terminal/index.html        # Terminal emulator
    games/
      asteroids.html           # Jarvis Asteroids
      doodlejump.html          # Doodle Jump
      draw.html                # Drawing canvas
      minesweeper.html         # Minesweeper
      pinball.html             # Pinball (with pinball.js, pinball.css)
      subway.html              # Subway Surfers
      tetris.html              # Tetris
      videoplayer.html         # Video player
```

The window icon (`jarvis-icon.png`) is compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!` so it does not need to be distributed alongside the binary. The Windows `.ico` icon is embedded into the `.exe` at build time by `build.rs`.

The `panels/` directory, however, must be available at runtime at the path `assets/panels/` relative to the current working directory.

### Plugin Directory

Local plugins are loaded from the platform config directory:

```
<config_dir>/jarvis/plugins/<plugin-id>/
  plugin.toml        # Plugin manifest (name, category, entry)
  index.html         # Default entry point (or custom per manifest)
  ...                # Additional plugin files
```

See the [Plugin System documentation](../plugins.md) for details.

---

## Configuration File Locations

Jarvis uses the standard platform configuration directories (via the `dirs` crate). On first run, a default `config.toml` is generated automatically if one does not exist.

### Config File

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/jarvis/config.toml` |
| **Linux** | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jarvis/config.toml` (default: `~/.config/jarvis/config.toml`) |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\jarvis\config.toml` |

### Data Directory

Stores identity keys, logs, and crash reports.

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/jarvis/` |
| **Linux** | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jarvis/` (default: `~/.local/share/jarvis/`) |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\jarvis\` |

Contents:

```
<data_dir>/jarvis/
  identity.json                # Crypto identity (P-256 keypair, auto-generated)
  logs/
    crash-reports/             # Panic crash dumps
```

### Cache Directory

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Caches/jarvis/` |
| **Linux** | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/jarvis/` (default: `~/.cache/jarvis/`) |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\jarvis\` |

### Plugin Directory

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/jarvis/plugins/` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/jarvis/plugins/` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\jarvis\plugins\` |

All directories are created automatically on startup via `jarvis_platform::paths::ensure_dirs()`.

---

## First Run Experience

When you launch Jarvis for the first time:

1. **Platform directories are created** -- config, data, cache, log, and crash-report directories are created if they do not already exist.

2. **Default config is generated** -- if no `config.toml` exists at the platform config path, Jarvis writes a fully-commented default configuration file. Every field has a sensible default; you only need to override what you want to change.

3. **Crypto identity is generated** -- a P-256 ECDSA/ECDH keypair is generated and stored in `identity.json` in the data directory. This is used for encrypted pairing with mobile devices. The keypair persists across sessions.

4. **Boot animation plays** -- Jarvis shows a boot animation (configurable via `[startup.boot_animation]` in config). Press any key to skip.

5. **Window opens** -- a 1280x800 window with a transparent titlebar (macOS) and GPU-rendered background.

6. **Panels load** -- webview panels (terminal, chat, assistant, games) are available via the command palette and keybinds.

### Verifying a Successful Launch

A successful startup produces log output like:

```
INFO jarvis: Jarvis v0.1.0 starting...
INFO jarvis: Config loaded (theme: jarvis-dark)
INFO jarvis: Keybind registry loaded (N bindings)
INFO jarvis: Entering event loop
INFO jarvis: Window created and renderer initialized
INFO jarvis: Crypto identity loaded
INFO jarvis: WebView registry initialized
```

---

## Environment Variables

Jarvis loads environment variables from a `.env` file on startup. It searches in this order:

1. Project root (three directories up from the `jarvis-app` crate manifest)
2. Rust workspace root (two directories up from the `jarvis-app` crate manifest)
3. Current working directory (`.env`)

Only variables that are not already set in the environment are loaded (existing env vars take precedence).

### Supported Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what you need. All values are optional -- the app degrades gracefully without them.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key for voice routing and data skills. Get one at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). | (none) |
| `PROJECTS_DIR` | Directory where Jarvis looks for code projects. | Jarvis repo root |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Claude Code OAuth token for the proxy connector. Most setups use CLI auth (`claude auth login`) instead. | (none) |
| `PRESENCE_URL` | WebSocket URL for the presence server. | `ws://localhost:8790` |
| `RUST_LOG` | Standard Rust logging filter. Overrides the default log directive. | (not set; defaults to `jarvis=info`) |
| `USER` / `USERNAME` | Used to determine the hostname for social/presence features. | System username |
| `SHELL` | (Unix) Shell to spawn in terminal panels. | `/bin/sh` |
| `COMSPEC` | (Windows) Command processor to spawn in terminal panels. | `cmd.exe` |

### Claude OAuth Token Setup (Legacy Python App)

The legacy Python app uses the Claude Agent SDK and authenticates via an OAuth token. Run the login script to set this up:

```bash
./login.sh
```

This script:

1. Runs `claude auth login` to open the browser-based OAuth flow
2. Extracts the access token from the macOS Keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`)
3. Writes the token to `.env` as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`

The token expires periodically; re-run `./login.sh` when authentication fails.

---

## CLI Arguments

The Jarvis binary accepts the following command-line arguments:

```
jarvis [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -e, --execute <COMMAND>     Execute a command instead of the default shell
  -d, --directory <PATH>      Working directory to start in
      --config <PATH>         Config file path override
      --log-level <LEVEL>     Log level override (debug, info, warn, error)
  -h, --help                  Print help
  -V, --version               Print version
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start in a specific directory
jarvis -d ~/projects/myapp

# Use a custom config file
jarvis --config /path/to/custom-config.toml

# Enable debug logging
jarvis --log-level debug

# Execute a specific command instead of the default shell
jarvis -e "python3 main.py"
```

## Common Build Issues and Solutions

### Linux: Missing system libraries

**Symptom**: Compilation errors referencing `x11`, `xkbcommon`, `wayland`, `gtk`, `webkit2gtk`, or `soup`.

**Solution**: Install all required development packages (see [Linux Prerequisites](#linux)).

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libxkbcommon-x11-dev libwayland-dev libgtk-3-dev \
  libsoup-3.0-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libxdo-dev
```

### Linux: `libxdo-dev` not found

**Symptom**: Build fails with errors related to `muda` or `xdotool`.

**Solution**: The `muda` crate (system menus) requires `libxdo-dev`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libxdo-dev
```

### Windows: Missing MSVC toolchain

**Symptom**: `error: linker 'link.exe' not found`

**Solution**: Install Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload:

1. Download [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
2. In the installer, select "Desktop development with C++"
3. Restart your terminal after installation

### Windows: WebView2 not available

**Symptom**: Application starts but webview panels are blank or fail to create.

**Solution**: Ensure the WebView2 runtime is installed. On Windows 10 1803+ and Windows 11, it should already be present. Otherwise install the [Evergreen Bootstrapper](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).

### Windows: `jarvis.ico` not found during build

**Symptom**: `Failed to compile Windows resources` error from `build.rs`.

**Solution**: Ensure you are building from the `jarvis-rs/` directory so the relative path `../../assets/jarvis.ico` resolves correctly. The icon file must exist at `jarvis-rs/assets/jarvis.ico`.

### macOS: wgpu fails to initialize

**Symptom**: `Failed to initialize renderer` at startup.

**Solution**: Ensure you have a Metal-compatible GPU (any Mac from 2012 onward). If running in a VM, Metal may not be available.

### All platforms: Panels not loading

**Symptom**: `Panels directory not found -- webviews will have no bundled content` warning in logs.

**Solution**: Run the Jarvis binary from the `jarvis-rs/` directory, or ensure `assets/panels/` exists relative to the current working directory.

```bash
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs
./target/release/jarvis
```

### Config load failure

**Symptom**: `Config load failed, using defaults` warning.

**Solution**: This is non-fatal. Jarvis falls back to built-in defaults. If you want to fix your config, check the config file for TOML syntax errors:

```bash
# macOS
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/jarvis/config.toml

# Linux
cat ~/.config/jarvis/config.toml

# Windows (PowerShell)
cat $env:APPDATA\jarvis\config.toml
```

Delete the file to have Jarvis regenerate a fresh default on next launch.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

In addition to the build prerequisites above, install:

```bash
# Clippy (linter) and rustfmt (formatter) -- usually included with stable
rustup component add clippy rustfmt

# cargo-audit (optional, for security audits)
cargo install cargo-audit
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs

# Run all workspace tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests for a specific crate
cargo test -p jarvis-config
cargo test -p jarvis-tiling
cargo test -p jarvis-platform

# Run tests with output
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture

# Run a specific test
cargo test --workspace test_name
```

### Code Quality Checks

These match what CI runs on every push and pull request:

```bash
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Run clippy with warnings-as-errors (matches CI RUSTFLAGS)
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Security audit
cargo audit
```

### Debug Builds

Debug builds are the default and compile significantly faster than release builds:

```bash
cd jarvis/jarvis-rs
cargo run
```

To enable verbose logging during development:

```bash
# Via CLI argument
cargo run -- --log-level debug

# Via environment variable
RUST_LOG=jarvis=debug cargo run

# Trace-level logging for a specific crate
RUST_LOG=jarvis_renderer=trace,jarvis=debug cargo run
```

### Developer Config Options

Add these to your `config.toml` for development:

```toml
[advanced.developer]
show_fps = true              # Show FPS counter
show_debug_hud = true        # Show debug overlay
inspector_enabled = true     # Enable WebView inspector (right-click -> Inspect)
```

### Workspace Structure

The Rust workspace (`jarvis-rs/`) is organized into focused crates:

```
jarvis-rs/
  Cargo.toml                  # Workspace root
  assets/                     # Runtime assets (panels, icons)
  crates/
    jarvis-app/               # Main application binary, window, event loop
    jarvis-common/            # Shared types, error definitions
    jarvis-config/            # TOML config loading, schema, hot-reload (notify)
    jarvis-platform/          # Platform paths, clipboard, crypto, keybinds
    jarvis-tiling/            # Window tiling / layout engine
    jarvis-renderer/          # GPU rendering (wgpu), text rendering (glyphon)
    jarvis-ai/                # AI provider integration (Claude, etc.)
    jarvis-social/            # Presence, multiplayer, relay client
    jarvis-webview/           # WebView management (wry)
    jarvis-relay/             # Standalone WebSocket relay server binary
```

### CI Pipeline

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

1. **Check and Lint** (Ubuntu): `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy`
2. **Security Audit** (Ubuntu): `cargo audit`
3. **Tests** (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows): `cargo test --workspace`
4. **Release Builds** (all targets): `cargo build --release` for:
   - `x86_64-apple-darwin`
   - `aarch64-apple-darwin`
   - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Experimental Features

The `jarvis-social` crate has an experimental feature flag:

```bash
# Enable experimental collaboration features (voice chat, screen sharing, pair programming)
# WARNING: These features have no authentication -- do NOT enable in production.
cargo build --features jarvis-social/experimental-collab
```
